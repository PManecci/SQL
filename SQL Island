WHERE state = "friendly"

#3. Find a friendly weaponsmith to forge us a sword

SELECT *
FROM item
WHERE owner IS NULL

#8. Update all ownerless items to reflect you as the new owner

#9. Then get a list of all of your new items

SELECT *
FROM item 
WHERE owner = 20

#10. Now search for friendly dealers or merchants who may want to purchase your new items

SELECT *
FROM inhabitant
WHERE state = "friendly" AND job = "dealer" OR job = "merchant"

#11. A merchant wants to purchase our ring and teapot - transfer ownership to her of both items

#12. We don't have enough gold for the sword, update your name so we can apply for a job

UPDATE inhabitant
SET name = "Patrick"
WHERE personid = 20

#13. We enjoy baking so let's search for bakers in the village that we could work for

WHERE job = "baker"
ORDER BY gold DESC

FROM inhabitant
JOIN village ON village.villageid = inhabitant.villageid
WHERE village.name = "Onionville" AND inhabitant.personid = village.chief

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM inhabitant
JOIN village ON village.villageid = inhabitant.villageid

SELECT SUM(gold)
FROM inhabitant
WHERE job IN ("baker", "merchant", "dealer")

#19. Determine the average amount of gold held by people in each state (friendly, etc...)

SELECT state, AVG(gold) 
FROM inhabitant
GROUP BY state

#20. Looks like the villians have the most gold, so my best option is just to take out Dirty Dieter with my sword. Might as well take out Dirty Diane as well!

DELETE FROM inhabitant
WHERE name = "Dirty Diane"

#21. Now let's release the pilot

UPDATE inhabitant
SET state = "friendly"
WHERE job = "pilot"

The pilot agrees to fly me home! Challenge completed!
