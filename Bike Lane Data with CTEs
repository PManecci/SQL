# In this SQL code, I'm queriying a database containing bike lane data using PostgreSQL as well as applying CTEs

# Presented Questions: 

## 1. List all bike lanes with an average safety rating of 4.0 or higher

WITH avgSafetyTable AS(
    SELECT street, AVG(safetyrating) AS avgSafetyRating
    FROM CityBikeLanes
    GROUP BY street
)

SELECT street, avgSafetyRating
FROM avgSafetyTable
WHERE avgSafetyRating >= 4;

## 2. Create a table showing the average safety rating for each of these bike lanes and a label that says "Safe Lane"

WITH avgSafetyTable AS(
    SELECT street, AVG(safetyrating) AS avgSafetyRating
    FROM CityBikeLanes
    GROUP BY street
)

SELECT street, avgSafetyRating, 'Safe Lane' AS tag
FROM avgSafetyTable
WHERE avgSafetyRating >= 4

## Results:
