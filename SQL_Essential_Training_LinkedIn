##PROJECT##

PROBLEM: There is a financial discrepency between 2011 and 2012
TASK: Locate the discrepency and narrow down a list of the prime suspects (people or items) for the possible cause of discrepency

##PROCESS##

/* Start with high-level data mining - look at invoice records for dates between 2011 and 2012
Start with the number of records and total sales (sum of invoices) */

SELECT Count(InvoiceID), SUM(Total)
FROM Invoice
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE "2011%" OR InvoiceDate LIKE "2012%"

RESULTS: 167 Invoices resulting in a Total earning of $1,947.97

/* Now start drilling down to match customers and employees to those records and 
search for disrepencies between invoices in this time frame with invoices over all available data */

/* 1. List of customers who are associated with invoices during time period */

SELECT I.InvoiceId, I.CustomerId, C.FirstName, C.LastName
FROM Invoice AS I
  JOIN Customer AS C
    ON C.CustomerId = I.CustomerId
WHERE I.InvoiceDate LIKE "2011% OR I.InvoiceDate LIKE "2012%"
GROUP BY C.CustomerId

RESULTS: A list of 60 individual customers that had invoices during this time frame

/* 2. List of Employees that are associated with invoices during time period */

SELECT E.FirstName, E.LastName
FROM Invoice AS I
  JOIN Customer AS C
    ON C.CustomerId = I.CustomerId
  JOIN Employee AS E
    ON C.SupportRepId = E.EmployeeId
WHERE I.InvoiceDate LIKE "2011% OR I.InvoiceDate LIKE "2012%"
GROUP BY E.EmployeeId

RESULTS: A list of 3 employees listed as Support Reps for invoices during time period: Jane Peacock, Margaret Park & Steve Johnson

/* 3. Find invoices with totals larger than the average invoice total for this time period */

SELECT InvoiceId, Total
FROM Invoice
WEHERE Total > (SELECT AVG(Total)
                FROM Invoice 
                WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE "2011% OR InvoiceDate LIKE "2012%")
ORDER BY Total DESC

RESULTS: 63 invoices had totals greater than the average with one stand out of $1000.86 for a single invoice (InvoiceId 413)

/* 4. Find the average invoice total across all invoices regardless of date - are there any other invoices this large? */

SELECT AVG(Total)
FROM Invoice

RESULTS: The average total invoice across all sales is only $8.06 and the second largest total invoice for any date is $25.86 
so Invoice 413 with a Total of $1000.86 is definitely our anomaly! 

/* 5. Find the Customer and Employee associated with this particular invoice */

SELECT I.InvoiceId, I.Total, C.FirstName, C.LastName, E.FirstName, E.LastName
FROM Invoice AS I
  JOIN Customer AS C
    ON C.CustomerId = I.CustomerId
  JOIN Employee AS E
    ON C.SupportRepId = E.EmployeeId
WHERE I.InvoiceId = 413

RESULTS: The Customer associated with this invoice is John Doeein and the Employee associated with the invoice is Jane Peacock

##CONCLUSION##

I looked as these two people and the Customer is missing many key values (no address, company, or contact information) so it looks like the
person we need to talk to regarding this financial discrepency is Jane Peacock!
