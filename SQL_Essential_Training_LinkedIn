##PART 1##

PROBLEM: There is a financial discrepency between 2011 and 2012
TASK: Locate the discrepency and narrow down a list of the prime suspects (people or items) for the possible cause of discrepency

##PROCESS##

/* Start with high-level data mining - look at invoice records for dates between 2011 and 2012
Start with the number of records and total sales (sum of invoices) */

SELECT Count(InvoiceID), SUM(Total)
FROM Invoice
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE "2011%" OR InvoiceDate LIKE "2012%"

RESULTS: 167 Invoices resulting in a Total earning of $1,947.97

/* Now start drilling down to match customers and employees to those records and 
search for disrepencies between invoices in this time frame with invoices over all available data */

/* 1. List of customers who are associated with invoices during time period */

SELECT I.InvoiceId, I.CustomerId, C.FirstName, C.LastName
FROM Invoice AS I
  JOIN Customer AS C
    ON C.CustomerId = I.CustomerId
WHERE I.InvoiceDate LIKE "2011% OR I.InvoiceDate LIKE "2012%"
GROUP BY C.CustomerId

RESULTS: A list of 60 individual customers that had invoices during this time frame

/* 2. List of Employees that are associated with invoices during time period */

SELECT E.FirstName, E.LastName
FROM Invoice AS I
  JOIN Customer AS C
    ON C.CustomerId = I.CustomerId
  JOIN Employee AS E
    ON C.SupportRepId = E.EmployeeId
WHERE I.InvoiceDate LIKE "2011% OR I.InvoiceDate LIKE "2012%"
GROUP BY E.EmployeeId

RESULTS: A list of 3 employees listed as Support Reps for invoices during time period: Jane Peacock, Margaret Park & Steve Johnson

/* 3. Average amount of individual invoices from this time period */
