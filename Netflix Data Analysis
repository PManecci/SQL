#In this SQL code, I'm queriying a database containing Netflix data using PostgreSQL to answer the following questions or complete assigned tasks:

#1. How many movie titles are there in the database? (movies only, not tv shows)
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
WHERE titles.type LIKE 'Movie';
#ANSWER = 6131

#2. When was the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added to the database? 

#3. List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order.

#4. Who was the director for the movie Bright Star?
