# In this SQL code, I'm queriying a database containing bike lane data using PostgreSQL as well as applying Window Functions

# Presented Request: a list of all the bike lanes, both safety ratings for each lane, the average safety rating for each lane, 
  and a label with the recommendation as "Remove", "Leave As-Is", or "Improvements Needed".
  
## 1. I'm going to start with creating the list of all bike lanes, individual safety ratings and average safety rating using a window function:

SELECT street, safetyrating,
AVG(safetyrating) OVER (PARTITION BY street) as "Average_safety_rating"
FROM CityBikeLanes;

## 2. Now I'm going to add on to that function the requested recommendation labels based on the average safety ratings

SELECT street, safetyrating,
AVG(safetyrating) OVER (PARTITION BY street) as "Average_safety_rating",
CASE 
    WHEN AVG(safetyrating) OVER (PARTITION BY street) >= 4 THEN 'Leave-As-Is'
    WHEN AVG(safetyrating) OVER (PARTITION BY street) < 2.5 THEN 'Remove'
    ELSE 'Improvements Needed'
END as recommendation
FROM CityBikeLanes;
