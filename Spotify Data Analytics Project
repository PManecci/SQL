# In this SQL code, I'm queriying a public database containing Spotify data (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/equinxx/spotify-top-50-songs-in-2021?select=spotify_top50_2021.csv) 
and using PostgreSQL to answer the following questions to gain insight into the trends in these Top 50 Songs:

# 1. Do any artists appear more than once in this top 50 list and, if so, which artist appears the most? 

SELECT artist_name, COUNT(id) AS total_songs
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY total_songs DESC;

# ANSWER: Olivia Rodrigo and Doja Cat are tied with 4 songs each in the top 50! 

# 2. Which of these top 50 songs had the highest popularity rating? 

SELECT track_name, popularity
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC;

# ANSWER: Three songs tied with popularity scores of 95: good 4 u by Olivia Rodrigo, Bad Habits by Ed Sheeran & Woman by Doja Cat

# 3. Is a song's duration a determing factor in it's popularity score? Is there a trend favoring longer or shorter songs and what is the average song duration for these top 50?

First, I found the Average song duration in Minutes (the duration is provided in milliseconds in the database): 

SELECT ROUND((AVG(duration_ms)/1000)/60,2) AS Duration_Minutes
FROM Spotifydata

ANSWER: The average duration of all 50 top songs is 3 minutes and 29 seconds

Then, I decided to look at shortest and longest songs and their correlating popularity scores:

SELECT track_name, popularity, ROUND((duration_ms/1000)/60,2) AS Duration_Minutes
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY Duration_Minutes ASC
LIMIT 1;

SELECT track_name, popularity, ROUND((duration_ms/1000)/60,2) AS Duration_Minutes
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY Duration_Minutes DESC
LIMIT 1;

ANSWER: The shortest song, MONTERO (Call Me By Your Name) has a popularity score of 90 and the longest song, Drivers License has a popularity score of 92

As a result there does not appear to be a wide range in song length within this data set and that duration does not appear to have a noticible impact on the popularity score.
