##THE MYSTERY##
We are searching for who committed the murder that occurred on Jan. 15, 2018 in SQL City. 

#1. Retrieve the crime scene report from the database: 
*/ I first ran a select all on the crime_scene_report table to determine how the dates were formatted and the column headers, 
from there I wrote the following query to pull the correct report for the case we are looking into /*

SELECT *
FROM crime_scene_report
WHERE date = 20180115 AND city = "SQL City" AND type = "murder";

RESULT: One report providing the following information: 
"Security footage shows that there were 2 witnesses. 
The first witness lives at the last house on "Northwestern Dr". 
The second witness, named Annabel, lives somewhere on "Franklin Ave".

#2. Locate the witnesses and their respective interviews:
*/ Looking at the tables available the next step should be to review the interviews from the two witnesses - 
I ran a query on the interview table and it provides only a person_id and transcript so I will have to use the person table 
to locate the witness's person_id and then match that to the correct transcript /*
